HOMEWORK 1

After the installation of Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, and the required virtual environment, you will have to test that everything has been set up correctly. For that purpose, you will have to execute the following code and run it without errors.

The code loads an image and creates a picture collage consisting of 4 pictures. Each of the four pictures is a version of the original image with the colour channels swapped.

You will also have to also finish some part of the code :-)


Load an image (you can freely chose any image you like)

Convert it to RGB

Split the image into the three colour channels

Compose the image in the RGB colour space

Compose the image in the RBG colour space

Compose the image in the GRB colour space

Compose the image in the BGR colour space

Create the collage

Plot the collage

And now you are going to make a simple geometric collage. You need to flip your image both horizontally and vertically to obtain the following result.
You can flip the images "manually" but you might also find useful the numpy functions fliplr and flipud ;-).
